## Game Ideas
- pulse camera slightly when the ball hits the track or deform the track to show the hit
- sync bounce with music
- don't clear tiles we have passed, it looks bad, either fade them out or preferably wait until they are out of camera view before clearing them (-5 or something)
- experiment with non-linear courses, maybe getting thinner and wider or splitting the route or changing the x center, the camera would need to smoothly adjust to follow the action
- powerup ideas
  - better handling
  - smart bomb (for when we introduce enemies)
  - increased jump height
  - random number of slam tokens
  - random number of coins
- slam mechanic where the user presses the slam button and the ball imediately slams into the ground and bounces with a greater bounce height, this can be used to force a bounce when you otherwise see yourself bouncing into the center of a hole, maybe limit it to be a powerup, we could maybe have a cool lightning effect that dissipates throughout the track from the location of the slam
- height variation, maybe have paths that lead up and down, again the camera would need to adjust
- fade/dissolve tiles once they’re behind the camera instead of hard clearing (emissive falloff or sinking animation)
- camera personality: slight tilt/roll based on lateral velocity, subtle FOV pulse on near-misses or slams
- ball trail/vfx: speed-based trail ribbon/particles; hazard hits emit a quick red shockwave across nearby tiles
- rhythm hooks: bounce-timed UI pulses or tile emissive flickers even before full music sync
- dynamic track segments: moving/oscillating tiles, conveyor rows that modify scroll, “low-grav” zones altering bounce params
- booster tiles: landing on one of these propels the ball forward allowing the player to clear bigger gaps (3-4 tiles)
- enemy probes: simple hovering obstacles drifting across lanes—good smart-bomb targets later
- HUD flare: “Perfect Slam” / “Near Miss” callouts to reward skill moments
